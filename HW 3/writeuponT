One potential way to speed up the processing for the planner is to store the position of the node that got us there during the propagation function, in, say, a field called origin. In this way we don't need to make any checks for out of bounds or to check the values in the neighboring nodes. This would increase the amount of storage required (though not significantly) but would effectively do the planner's job for it, as it would only need to construct a chain of nodes by querying the current node's origin value.
